## Associated
Krimson was originally connected to the Aconite Friend Group when they had been in Unlucky's discord server at the time of Unlucky SMP.
He was asked and added to the server due to his presence in Unlucky's discord server and his connection to Nopeable from the past.

Unlucky SMP contained a few mods which were not permitted to be spread, most from Rattiest Gang at the time. We no longer own any of these mods.
One mod which was on the server was ContentContent, which was obtained from an old pack sent by RAT for a supporter event. Krimson had been the one to supply us with this mod, having participated in the event and having kept the pack after the event.

Krimson also revealed that he had access to a folder on his computer called “RAT Mods” which contained every single mod that was accessible to the public, legal or illegal. This included Elysium, ContentContent, Grindering and Every Lux and Rat Supporter mods.

We do not know if this folder is still on his PC or not, however at the time and to our knowledge, this folder is still in his possession.

## Carved
Nopeable, Krimson and Winter all had very different views about what the carved mod was, but the key point was that Krimson viewed it as " his mod " 

Carved became the first project Krimson began working on us with. Carved had been started by Winter and Krimson with the intention of being on the ULSMP server.
Winter had agreed to code Carved because he wanted it to go on the server. Krimson began by implementing Spirit Wood and Dark Marble.

After this, Krimson wanted to implement a Weapon into the mod. Winter agreed and they began working however in the process of creating the mod Krimson expressed he wanted to keep this major feature a secret. Winter agreed, however felt that the “Axe of Lament” was a bit overpowered and presented it to Nopeable as to get guidance on how to balance this weapon and to get criticism on how to implement it.

Nopeable had been inside of the coding process of Carved for a large portion of its development, so Winter figured it would be fine to ask for guidance on this.

In summary, Krimson wanted the “Axe of Lament” to be his weapon exclusive to him and implemented how he wanted it. Nopeable wanted the Weapon to be implemented as a more general weapon for the server's collective use.

Krimson was originally hesitate to agree to the change, however the original implementation of the Axe was to difficult for Winter to implement and Nopeable disliked the full concept of adding a weapon at the time, as Krimson agreed it would be a decor mod, however, in the end, both sides compromised and created the renamed “Spirit Greataxe”. which was a weapon usable by everyone.

At the time of Carved production being at a close to done state, Krimson suggested an entirely new portion of Carved he called, “Carved Dangers”

Later on, while Spirit Fire was being developed, Nopeable was again informed by Winter about most of the stuff that Krimson wanted to implement. As well as expressing a general dislike towards Krimson new direction towards Carved.

Nopeable, as Krimson predicted, did not like the new way that Krimson was going about Carved. However due to having issue with the Greataxe in the past decided that just throwing those ideas away won't solve the issue so he tried to continuously compromise with Krimson on features.

Examples of these compromises was, Spitfire Armor removing doing extra damage with fire in exchange for natural Fire Protection 4, Cigarettes being removed due to being mostly a joke item and Spirit Fire not burning Stone.

After this, while Winter was still working on Spirit Fire, he called Nopeable and said that he was having too much of a difficult time implementing Spirit Fire, and didn't want to make it, so he stopped.

Krimson was not happy with this, but eventually decided to move these features to another mod, called Torched.

He came up with a new idea, Plants

Winter didn't want to - or couldn't - make this. But Krimson was adamant, saying if he didn't make it, he would stop making textures for the mod.

Krimson later left aconite because he felt like no one was listening to his ideas

# The Joke
After leaving, he insisted on still playing on our SMP, with the " Eliminate Players " mod, custom edited for him. 

No one really liked this, but they let it happen.

Winter and Nopeable didn't download the mod, so they could still see him. While he was following them around, they made jokes about them having a mod called " Charter ", and planning on using them on the server.

Krimson then messaged Arathain, asking if " Charter " had ever been sent around. No.

Illogically, he used this to set Nyx and Herobrine to grief Nopeable's base on the smp

## Smudgy
