# Lantern Weed:
- Is an ancient under water plant
- Found in ancient city botanys/ancient botanys
- when bone mealed it will grow in height, and over time the lantern bulb/blooming lanterns will grow.
- when the lantern bulb is mined (has to be with an axe) the bulb will drop both it's self and another piece lantern weed (wich you will be able to plant)
- When the lantern bulb is cut (with a shear/axe) it will light up a huge area, and keep mobs from spawning
- When eaten it will make you silent, no one can hear what you do
# Lunar Root:
- Is an ancient vine
- Found in ancient city botanys/ancient botanys
- Shearing the lunar roots gives you lunar flowers
- bonemealing the the lunar root regrows the flowers, although if the flowers are already there it will grow the lunar fruit
- When eaten it would make everyone's pets passive to you, inculding soul moulds.
